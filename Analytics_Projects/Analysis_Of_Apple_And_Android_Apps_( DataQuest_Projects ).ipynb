    "Following the category description of google playstore Apps, Family category, has the highest representation with about 19% of total Apps, followed by the games category with 10% representation of total free english Apps in the google playstore. There are not that many apps designed for fun, and it seems that a good number of apps are designed for practical purposes (family, tools, business, lifestyle, productivity, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between the Genres and the Category columns is not crystal clear, but one thing we can notice is that the Genres column is much more granular (it has more categories). We're only looking for the bigger picture at the moment, so we'll only work with the Category column moving forward.\n",
    "\n",
    "Up to this point, we found that the App Store is dominated by apps designed for fun, while Google Play shows a more balanced landscape of both practical and for-fun apps. Now we'd like to get an idea about the kind of apps that have most users.\n",

    "## Analysis of iOS Apps with Most Users\n",
    "One way to find out what genres are the most popular (have the most users) is to calculate the average number of installs for each app genre. For the Google Play data set, we can find this information in the Installs column, but for the App Store data set this information is missing. As a workaround, we'll take the total number of user ratings as a proxy for number of installs. We can find this in the rating_count_tot column. This column measures how many users rated each App in the AppStore (since a user can only rate an App he/she has used, This hopes to serve as a good proxy variable).\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with calculating the average number of user ratings per app genre on the App Store. To do that, we'll need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Isolate the apps of each genre.\n",
    "* Sum up the user ratings for the apps of that genre.\n",
    "* Divide the sum by the number of apps belonging to that genre (not by the total number of apps).\n",
    "To calculate the average number of user ratings for each genre, we'll use a for loop inside of another for loop.\n",
    "*for a nested loop, for each iteration of the parent loop, the entire iterations of the child loop runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Steps**:\n",
    "* We created a variable called `prime_genre` which holds our `freq_table` function (the `freq_table` function is expected to create a frequency table of `prime_genre` column for AppStore dataset and show the percentage of items in the column)\n",
    "* `prime_genre` is expected to hold the unique App genres\n",
    "* We looped through the `prime_genre` and for each iteration, we initialized a variable `total` to zero (this variable is expected to hold the sum of all ratings in a particular genre).\n",
    "* Initialized a new variable `len_genre` to zero (this variable is expected hold the number of apps in each genre)\n",
    "* Created a nested loop, which iterates through each App in the free iOS Apps and for each iteration, appends the reviews column to a variable called `genre_app`\n",
    "* If OR each tim `genre_app` is same as `genre`, which is true because `genre` (the iterable variable of the `prime_genre` which now holds the) is the unique Apps genre and `genre_app` also holds the unique apps of the `free_ios` Apps.\n",
    "* Assign the number of user ratings for each App to a variable called `user_rating`\n",
    "* Increment the value of `total` to the `user_rating`, that is, the `user_rating` sums up each time the if condition holds true\n",
    "* Increment the length of each genre by 1.\n",
    "* Created a variable named `avg_user_rating` outside the nested for loop which holds the average user rating for each genre\n",
    "* Print `genre_app` with its corresponding average user rating"
