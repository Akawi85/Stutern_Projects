    "In this project, we'll work with a data set of submissions to popular technology site [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com). \n",
    "Hacker News is a site started by the startup incubator [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com), where user-submitted stories (known as \"posts\") are voted and commented upon, similar to reddit. Hacker News is extremely popular in technology and startup circles, and posts that make it to the top of Hacker News' listings can get hundreds of thousands of visitors as a result.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data set is Hacker News posts from the last 12 months (up to September 26 2016) and can be found [here](https://news.ycombinator.com). The data contains almost 300,000 rows. Below are descriptions of the columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **id**: The unique identifier from Hacker News for the post\n",
    "* **title**: The title of the post\n",
    "* **url** : The URL that the posts links to, if it the post has a URL\n",
    "* **num_points**: The number of points the post acquired, calculated as the total number of upvotes minus the total number of downvotes\n",
    "* **num_comments**: The number of comments that were made on the post\n",
    "* **author**: The username of the person who submitted the post\n",
    "* **created_at**: The date and time at which the post was submitted\n",
    "\n",
    "At Hacker News, Users can ask questions mostly related to tech and startups and also provide insights to projects, products or anything around tech generally. The norm at Hacker News is to use the tag \"Ask HN\" to ask questions and \"Show HN\" to show the community something interesting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The focus of this analysis is to compare the two types of posts (Ask HN and Show HN) in order to determine:\n",
    "* which amongst these posts have the highest number of comments on the average\n",
    "* The particular hours in which posts are likely to receive most comments on the average\n",
