This pseudocode uses simpson's diversity score--> https://sites.google.com/site/geographyfais/fieldwork/6-data-analysis/statistical-tools/diversity/diversity-index

This program will compute a company's diversity score given the number of staff that falls in each ethnic group within the company:


BEGIN
{
SET b as EmptySequenceVariable
SET N to total number of staff in the company

FOR each ethnic group across all ethnic groups

	COMPUTE n as total number of staff in each ethnic group
	COMPUTE d as n minus one
	COMPUTE e as n multiplied by d
	
	STORE e in b 
	
END FOR
	
COMPUTE diversity score as 1 minus (sum of b divide by N multiplied N minus 1)
}
END 

PS: Higher score signifies a more diverse company while lower score signifies a less diverse company
