# Code Repository for Web Scraping Course

This repository contains Jupyter Notebooks with code examples relating to the Real Python video course on Building a Web Scraper with `requests` and `Beautiful Soup`.

The notebooks 01-03 represent the **web scraping pipeline** discussed in the course:

- **Part 1: Inspect** `01_inspect.ipynb`
- **Part 2: Scrape** `02_scrape.ipynb`
- **Part 3: Parse** `03_parse.ipynb`

The notebook [scrape_150_python_jobs_in_newyork_from_indeed.ipynb](https://github.com/Akawi85/Stutern_Projects/blob/main/web_scrapping/scrape_150_python_jobs_in_newyork_from_indeed.ipynb) contains code where actual scrapping project was executed for 150 python jobs in new york from [indeed](indeed.com) and the result saved to the `indeed_jobs.csv` file

To run this code in your own local notebook, you're expected to install `bs4` and `requests` in your anaconda navigator app from the current environment where you execute your jupyter notebooks
